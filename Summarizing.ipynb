      "Within hours, the world will have a better idea about the prospects of a new Alzheimer's treatment when Japanese drugmaker Eisai releases late-stage clinical trial results.\n",
      "\n",
      "News of a second patient death linked to the drug has dampened expectations and potentially created a more complicated path for the drug hitting the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Researchers will present the clinical trial results for Eisai and its partner Biogen's drug lecanemab this evening at the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer’s Disease conference in San Francisco.Eisai shares fell by 6% on Tuesday after Science reported that a woman who was enrolled in a clinical trial for the drug died from a brain hemorrhage that researchers linked to the experimental treatment. It was the second death reported among patients who are part of the lecanemab trial. A patient who took Eliquis, a blood thinner, died in June after experiencing bleeding in the brain, according to an investigative report from STAT.\n",
      "\n",
      "In September, Eisai and Biogen said in a press release that lecanemab slowed the progression of Alzheimer's disease by 27% in phase III trials, offering renewed hope for an effective treatment for the disease after past efforts were mired in controversy.Biogen's Aduhelm was approved by the FDA in 2021 over strong objections by the agency's own advisory panel. Scientists say clinical trials for the drug were poorly conducted and that it's unclear whether it even works. Medicare refused to cover the $56,000 drug except when patients are enrolled in clinical trials, making Aduhelm a commercial failure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both patient deaths within the lecanemab trial involved people that took blood thinners to treat other ailments.Trial participants were warned that blood thinners and lecanemab \"are both associated with a slight risk of bleeding in the brain,\" according to the trial's patient consent form, which was obtained by Science. Both patients also had cerebral amyloid angiopathy, per STAT and Science, a condition that experts told Science likely makes the blood vessels more vulnerable to weakening during the treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The deaths, at the very least, could prompt regulators to limit approval of the drug for narrow patient populations.Many Alzheimer's patients take blood thinners, and nearly half have CAA, according to Science. That suggests potential lecanemab patients may need to be carefully screened. “If lots of people [on lecanemab] who go into the hospital with garden-variety strokes end up dying, that sets the field back decades,\" University of Kentucky neuroscientist Donna Wilcock told Science. A narrower patient population would subsequently mean a smaller revenue pool for Eisai and Biogen. Eisai previously said the potential \"annual value-based price\" of lecanemab was estimated at $9,249 to $35,605.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eisai has already submitted and application with the FDA for accelerated approval, and the company expects a decision by Jan. 6, 2023.The company plans to file for full approval by the end of March.\n",

      "A significant outbreak of severe thunderstorms including a \"few strong tornadoes,\" is unfolding for the Mississippi Valley, mid-South and parts of the Southeast Tuesday into Tuesday night.\n",
      "\n",
      "The storm threat is highest — at \"moderate risk\" or a level 4 out of 5 on the National Weather Service's (NWS) scale — in Mississippi. About 40 million people across the South are at risk for severe weather from this event, per the National Weather Service.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Mississippi, the Lowndes County Sheriff’s Office told WTVA-TV that they've received reports of people trapped and structural damage from a suspected tornado approximately 13 miles north of Columbus, but could not yet confirm injuries. The trapped individuals were later reported as being freed.In Louisiana, the NWS confirmed a tornado in Caldwell Parish caused structural damage approximately six miles southeast of Clarks, KNOE-TV reports.\n",
      "\n",
      "The National Weather Service has extended its \"Particularly Dangerous Situation\" tornado watch for southeast Arkansas, northeast Louisiana and central Mississippi through 2 am CT. The watch was originally meant to expire at 7 pm CT.The NWS noted the expectation of \"several tornadoes and a few intense tornadoes likely\" within the watch area as thunderstorms develop throughout the night. The watch contains the text: \"Scattered supercells will persist through early tonight, with a continued threat for a few strong tornadoes, damaging gusts, and large hail.\" Other tornado watches, though without the heightened alert language, have been issued for portions of southeastern Mississippi and western Alabama, including Tuscaloosa, through 11 pm CT. Multiple radar-confirmed and storm spotter-indicated tornadoes have been reported in Mississippi and Louisiana. Nighttime tornadoes tend to be especially dangerous, because people can lack ways to get severe weather warnings, and owners of mobile homes may not have easy access to storm shelters.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Weather Service is highlighting the threat for tornadoes very large hail and damaging straight-line winds for parts of Mississippi, Tennessee, Louisiana, Texas, Indiana, Missouri and Ohio.The storms are developing in a region of warm, humid air flowing north from the Gulf of Mexico, ahead of a cold front and low-pressure area moving into the Plains and Midwest. The associated dip in the jet stream and upper-level winds are aiding in storm development and intensification. Another front lifting north from Louisiana and Texas is also playing a role in triggering severe weather, including establishing strong winds that vary in speed and/or direction, known as wind shear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wind shear is a key ingredient for tornado formation, and the NWS notes that the tornado threat will be highest across Mississippi, possibly extending into surrounding states.An online NWS discussion states: \"Multiple rounds of severe thunderstorms -- some capable of long-tracked tornadoes with EF3+ damage potential — will be possible this afternoon into tonight over parts of the lower Mississippi Valley region and Mid-South.\" About 5 million people are at the greatest risk of severe weather, in areas either at \"enhanced\" or \"moderate\" risk on the NWS' threat level scale. Tornadoes of that intensity tend to cause the greatest damage and account for the most fatalities during the course of a year. Cities that may see severe weather include: Memphis and Nashville in Tennessee, as well as Jackson and Hattiesburg, Mississippi, Alexandria, New Orleans and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Birmingham, Alabama.\n",
      "\n",
      "While tornado season traditionally runs during the spring and summer months, there is a fall tornado season in the Southeast, and in years like this one when a La Niña is present in the tropical Pacific Ocean, the South and Southeast can be prone to tornado outbreaks well into the winter.\n",

      "\n",
      "Rhodes, a prominent figure within far-right American politics, faces a maximum of 20 years in prison from the conviction, though the jury also found him guilty on other charges.The seditious conspiracy verdict against Rhodes is one of the most significant results arising from the Department of Justice's vast investigation into the Jan. 6 riot. Seditious conspiracy, a rarely used Civil War-era law, is committed when two or more people in the U.S. conspire to overthrow, destroy, seize the property of or levy war against the U.S. government, or to prevent the execution of any U.S. law.\n",
      "\n",
      "one of Rhodes' antigovernment associates, Kelly Meggs, guilty of seditious conspiracy and other felonies.Defendants Jessica Watkins, Kenneth Harrelson and Thomas Caldwell were found not guilty of seditious conspiracy but guilty of other felonies. The jury, after deliberating for around three days, found all defendants guilty of obstruction of an official proceeding of Congress, while Meggs and Watkins were also found guilty of conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding of Congress. Rhodes, Meggs, Harrelson and Watkins also received guilty verdicts for conspiracy to prevent members of Congress from discharging their duties.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's a mixed bag. There are good results and bad results mixed together,\" Ed Tarple, Rhodes' lawyer, said outside the courthouse on Tuesday.\"We're grateful for the not-guilty verdicts that were received. We're disappointed in the guilty verdicts,\" Tarple added. Tarple said they plan to appeal the verdicts against Rhodes.\n",
      "\n",
      "federal prosecutors attempted to show through encrypted messages, recordings and surveillance video that Rhodes had organized and conspired with his associates to oppose the transfer of presidential power and overturn Biden’s victory.In the indictment against the defendants, the Department of Justice alleged that Rhodes and the others traveled to Washington, D.C. in the days before Jan. 6, where they armed themselves with firearms and tactical gear and were prepared to take up arms to stop the peaceful transfer of power. Lawyers for Rhodes had argued he and other Oath Keepers members traveled to and organized in D.C. in anticipation that then-President Trump would use powers under the Insurrection Act to form a militia and wanted to protect his supporters.On the witness stand, Rhodes said the group did not prepare for or intend to storm the Capitol. But prosecutors argued the defendants weren't accused of moving to storm the Capitol but were instead indicted for agreeing to stop Congress' certification of the presidential election by force.\n",
      "\n",
      "The verdicts may serve as a preview for the upcoming trial against Proud Boys leader Henry \"Enrique\" Tarrio and other members who were also charged with seditious conspiracy for their actions around and on the day of the riot.Some members of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers involved in the riot have already pleaded guilty to seditious conspiracy charges, while hundreds of other people have pleaded guilty or were convicted of other charges stemming from Jan. 6.\n",

      "President Biden on Monday called on Congress to pass legislation forcing railroad workers to accept the labor contract that the White House brokered in September \"to avert a potentially crippling national rail shutdown.\"\"As a proud pro-labor President, I am reluctant to override the ratification procedures and the views of those who voted against the agreement,\" the president said in a statement. \"But in this case — where the economic impact of a shutdown would hurt millions of other working people and families — I believe Congress must use its powers to adopt this deal.\"\n",

      "It increasingly seemed negotiations between the freight rail companies and their unions weren't moving. And if both sides don't reach a deal by Dec. 9, rail workers could strike — an economically devastating move that could cost an estimated $2 billion a day.Previously, White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said they would prefer both sides to work this out themselves, as the Washington Post reported. Congressional Democrats had been waiting on White House guidance before acting, WaPo also reported. Some rail workers had been lobbying members of Congress for a few days of paid sick leave, which isn't included in the Biden-brokered deal. The president shut down any ideas about that addition in his statement. \"Some in Congress want to modify the deal to either improve it for labor or for management. However well-intentioned, any changes would risk delay and a debilitating shutdown, \" Biden said. \"The agreement was reached in good faith by both sides.\"\n",

      "Some progressive lawmakers signaled their opposition to the bill after the White House meeting on Tuesday, including Reps. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.).\"Every worker deserves paid sick leave,\" Bush wrote in a tweet. \"I will not support a deal that does not provide our rail workers with the paid sick leave they need and deserve,\" she said. \"Listen, I can’t in good conscience vote for a bill that doesn’t give rail workers the paid leave they deserve,\" Bowman also wrote on Twitter.\n",

      "A massive Twitter staff exodus in the first month of Elon Musk's ownership is only exacerbating the company's long list of existing data security problems, experts tell Axios.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Twitter's list of cybersecurity challenges hasn't appeared to change yet, dwindling staff numbers mean the company could struggle to fix security flaws or respond in the event of a massive hack.The departures of Twitter's chief information security officer and other top security employees have created a new layer of concern about the company's long-existing data-security issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Twitter already had a troubled history of data breaches, account takeovers and poor internal cybersecurity hygiene.Earlier this year, former Twitter CISO Peiter \"Mudge\" Zatko filed a whistleblower complaint detailing the extent of Twitter's security problems, from a lack of employee access controls to a company culture that failed to take cybersecurity seriously. In 2020, a 22-year-old hacker broke into Twitter and took over accounts belonging to then-presidential candidate Joe Biden, former President Barack Obama and Musk himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cybersecurity alarm bells in the last month mostly stem from reports of the company's quickly shrinking staff numbers rather than new and emerging threats.But without a full security team, it's hard to see how the company can respond quickly to patch vulnerabilities in its systems or a massive data breach of its systems, says Erick Galinkin, an analyst at cybersecurity company Rapid7. Glitches have already started at Twitter, presumably due to low staff levels, including a bug that broke Twitter's multifactor authentication tool shortly after the latest employee exodus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Experts have anticipated that ongoing turbulence at Twitter will only motivate more hackers and scammers to target the company and its users.Most data breaches would affect data that's likely already floating around on the dark web from past hacks, including email addresses, passwords and birthdates. Twitter doesn't collect someone's most sensitive information, such as their Social Security number, and it has financial information only for Twitter Blue subscribers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hackers and Twitter employees could potentially learn a lot from someone's private direct messages depending on what information is shared.Some users may have shared personal information in what they perceived as secure private messages, for example. It's likely more hackers will be newly motivated to \"leak every Twitter DM\" just to embarrass Musk's leadership, Galinkin says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Musk appears to be trying to create a slightly more secure Twitter based on his reported plans to encrypt direct messages and support encrypted video and voice calling between accounts, as The Verge reports . But it's unclear how quickly those plans will come to fruition, especially with a smaller staff.Security could become an even bigger priority as Musk pushes to grow subscriber numbers and pursues projects to support in-app payments. Twitter is likely to face further regulatory pressure to improve its internal security practices as the Federal Trade Commission watches Musk's takeover unfold. Twitter did not respond to a request for comment.\n",

      "While the data security concerns at Twitter are nothing new, they do serve as a reminder to be mindful of what you share on the internet.\"You don't need to be any more worried than you should have been a month ago,\" Galinkin says.\n",

      "As Biden weighs a final decision on whether to run for a second term, White House officials are showing how the powers of the presidency can be harnessed for a re-election campaign.\n",
      "\n",
      "The emerging strategy is on full display this week. Biden is traveling to Michigan to talk domestic manufacturing and semiconductors, addressing tribal nations at the Interior Department, and hosting a glitzy state dinner for French President Emmanuel Macron.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a formula we can expect to see more of over the next two years as legislating comes to a standstill: diplomatic engagements to emphasize Biden’s statesman role, day trips to swing states and special attention for key Democratic constituencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Biden advisers don't expect the president to dominate the news cycle; they want him to fly above it.Democrats' better-than-expected showing in the midterms confirmed team Biden’s theory of the electorate: Voters are concerned about protecting democracy and women’s reproductive rights, and give Biden passing grades on the economy. Biden didn’t pay a political price for only visiting friendly states and spending most weekends at home in Delaware or at Camp David. Many voters appeared to accept his argument that inflation was a global phenomenon and not the direct result of his spending.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The midterms validated the President’s focus on delivering for the American people and speaking to their priorities,” said a Biden adviser.“Since taking office, he’s traveled the country talking about how he’s lowering costs, bringing back manufacturing and supply chains, protecting and strengthening our democracy at home and abroad, taking action to protect women’s rights and enact tougher gun safety measures and more,” the adviser said. \"Voters overwhelmingly affirmed his plan for taking the country forward, so it makes a lot of sense he’s staying focused on continuing to deliver on all the things he’s been talking about forever.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Officials are preparing for Biden to get comfortable with — or at least formally embrace — a decision he may have already made on some level. He loves being president and hates the idea of Trump restoring his reign.At the same time, running for president — even from the comfort of the White House and with the advantage of Air Force One — is physically and mentally draining.No one has any illusions about how difficult a re-election campaign will be, especially with an economy staring at a recession.\n",
      "\n",
      "Officials also know that they need to increase their fundraising to underwrite a big campaign, which will likely be headquartered outside of Washington, either in Delaware or Philadelphia.White House holiday parties are one way that officials plan to reconnect with big-dollar donors, some of whom have felt left out in the cold by Biden’s inner circle.The closely watched Job Openings and Labor Turnover data for October will be released at 10am ET on Wednesday.

      "A decade after voice assistant technology captured the world's imagination, Alexa and Siri appear to be on the wane.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alexa's rise and fall shows that for every winner in the tech industry's neverending game of \"dominate the next platform,\" there are multiple money-incinerating losers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amid tech’s biggest slump in two decades, companies are tightening their belts and decreasing investments in secondary devices and voice assistants.Earlier this month, a report from Insider detailed that Amazon workers had determined that Alexa was a “colossal failure of imagination” and “wasted opportunity.” Insider reports its division was on track to lose up to $10 billion in 2022. This was followed by news of Amazon’s biggest layoffs to date, with Alexa's team reportedly among those heavily affected by the cuts. A month ago, Google reportedly decided to scale back development and support for its Google Assistant.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Siri first hit the market with the iPhone 4S in 2011, it was championed as “probably one of the most novel applications Apple has ever produced.”Amazon released the first Echo featuring Alexa in 2014 and it was a hit, selling 5 million devices in the first two years. Investments followed, and in 2018, Amazon said it had over 10,000 engineers working on Alexa and Echo products. One high-water mark for the cultural optimism about the technology was \"Her,\" the 2013 movie whose main character falls in love with his voice assistant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though voice assistants have become a literal fixture in millions of homes, they have not delivered on their creators' revenue targets.Amazon’s goal with Alexa was not to make money selling the devices but to give users an even easier way of ordering from the retail giant. Insider reports that a few years into Alexa’s life, Amazon saw billion of interactions a week, but most of them were trivial usages that did not open money-making opportunities. “We kept waiting, waiting, waiting for a huge percentage of consumers to say, ‘I bought a pizza’ [on my Echo],” Consumer Intelligence Research Partners cofounder Michael Levin told Fast Company. “It never materialized. People do not buy stuff, by and large.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Amazon points to internal statistics showing a 30% increase in Alexa interactions over the past year and says it's \"still in the earliest days of what Alexa will become.\"\"The fact is, Alexa has changed how people interact with technology, and we are observing incredible momentum with our customers. We are as committed as ever to Alexa, and will continue to invest heavily in it,\" an Amazon spokesperson told Axios.\n",

      "have slowly evolved to understand more complex commands, research shows that most people use them for simpler tasks like checking the weather or making a call.The tech has also become something of a punchline as jokes center on Alexa or Siri mishearing a user or providing unhelpful information. Meanwhile, a February report from Voicebot Research showed that fewer Americans used voice assistants in 2021 compared with 2020.Smaller efforts from big companies, like Microsoft’s Cortana and Samsung’s Bixby, have also seemingly failed to gain traction in the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Voice assistants have also faced growing concerns over consumer privacy.A 2020 survey from DataGrail found that over 82% of respondents had concerns about monitoring or data collection from phone microphones, laptop webcams, home devices like Amazon Echo, or devices with location tracking. In 2019, Bloomberg reported that Amazon had a team of thousands who listened to conversations recorded through Alexa in efforts to improve the service. Also in 2019, The Guardian reported that some private conversations and audio recorded by Siri was being shared by Apple with contractors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Voice assistants have proven to have a wide range of applications and champions, even if not in the ways Amazon and Apple originally planned.Voice input has been hugely important in providing greater tech accessibility, offering those with limited vision, motor impairments or other challenges a smoother way to interact with devices. The world of “Internet of Things” products has produced an ecosystem of devices that can be controlled with users’ voices.\n",
      "\n",
      "to be an invaluable secondary input when users' hands are otherwise busy.Using voice commands has increasingly allowed drivers to keep their hands on steering wheels. And a 2016 study showed that 62% of iPhone users used Siri in the car. Additionally, innovations in wearables like VR headsets and AR glasses have also leaned on voice inputs so users don't have to keep touching their heads or carry around awkward controllers.\n",

      "\n",
      "Videos and photos posted to social media are one of the only ways to get information about the protests since information is tightly controlled in China and journalism in the country is heavily restricted .\n",
      "\n",
      "The largest protests since the Tiananmen pro-democracy movement in 1989 have been spreading across China in response to pandemic policies that have seen people locked into their apartments for weeks or even months at a time, damaged the economy and made daily life uncertain for hundreds of millions of people.When asked at a press briefing on Monday if China would end the zero-COVID policy due to the protests, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said, \"what you mentioned does not reflect what actually happened.\" He added that China would continue to adjust its policies in line with its stated pandemic prevention measures.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Monday, Chinese authorities flooded previous protest areas in Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong with police vans and security forces to preempt further demonstrations.Some universities, also the site of numerous protests, announced they would close early for Lunar New Year so students would return home. The measures seemed to have an effect, as protesters in Beijing and Shanghai did not return to previous demonstration sites on Monday night. Online censors deleted social media posts and articles about the protests, while official media did not cover them. On Twitter, which is not accessible in China, a deluge of spam posts appeared under hashtags related to the protests, making it more difficult to use Twitter to track what was happening, per the Washington Post.\n",
      "\n",
      "One former Shanghai resident surnamed Wang told Axios she has been staying up late every night since Friday grabbing screenshots of articles and social media posts about the protests, posting them on WeChat, and sending them to friends so the posts can still be viewed in China.\"None of this is organized. There’s no group chat of us saying we should screenshot this before it’s deleted,\" said Wang, who moved to Taipei a few months ago and asked to withhold her full name in order to protect family and friends in China.Over the weekend, countless Chinese social media users posted and reposted messages intended to convey clear dissent but circumvent censors, such as lines of black squares in place of words or including speeches by Chinese officials.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"While the Chinese people haven’t had a choice, they have had a system that they basically trust,\" Wang said. Many surveys find Chinese people have high trust in their government but other data describes a diversity of views.Wang lived through the two-month-long Shanghai lockdown earlier and described the experience as \"collective trauma,\" with no end in sight. \"To have a government that you trust betray you to this degree, and to betray your compliance to the system, why are we surprised that people are angry?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Chinese authorities relaxed some COVID restrictions on Monday but show no signs yet of abandoning the policy completely.\"If the protests result in the end of the zero COVID policy but not the end of authoritarianism in China, the protests have still succeeded, because they improved the people’s lives,\" Wang told Axios.\n",
