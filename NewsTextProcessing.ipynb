      "\n",
      " Payton Gendron, 19, faces a mandatory life sentence for perpetrating what the FBI has called a case of racially motivated violent extremism .\n",
      "\n",
      "  The 25-count state court indictment included 10 first-degree murder charges and three counts of attempted murder as a hate crime.The domestic terrorism count carries life without parole — no maximum or minimum. Gendron had initially pleaded not guilty, but attorneys for victims' families said earlier this month they had been informed that he planned to change his plea and waive his right to appeal.\n",
      "\n",
      " Gendron, who was 18 at the time of the shooting, allegedly drove over 200 miles to carry out the attack in the predominantly Black neighborhood. Eleven of the 13 people he shot were Black.The semiautomatic rifle he used had been inscribed with a racial epithet and the number 14, a white supremacist numeric symbol. He also live-streamed the shooting on Twitch for about two minutes, allowing for screenshots that circulated online in the following days.\n",
      "\n",
      " Historically, Black people have been the most targeted group for hate crimes in most cities.Attacks on Black and Asian people drove much of the increase in hate crimes in the 2020 fiscal year, which saw the highest number of reported hate crimes in 20 years, according to the FBI.\n",
      "\n",
      " Gendron has a sentencing hearing for the state charges scheduled for Feb. 15, though he still also faces 27 federal charges — 14 hate crimes charges and 13 firearms charges.\"Gendron's motive for the mass shooting was to prevent Black people from replacing white people and eliminating the white race, and to inspire others to commit similar attacks,\" prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of New York wrote in a June court filing. \"He selected the Tops store because it is where a high percentage and high density of Black people can be found,'\" U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said at a press conference in June.\n",
      "\n",
      " The New York attorney general's office said in an investigative report last month that Gendron \"was first indoctrinated and radicalized\" through online platforms where he consumed \"explicitly racist, bigoted, and violent content.\"The case has led to renewed scrutiny over social media platforms' moderation and policy enforcement.\n",

      "\u001b[31mThe 2021 heat wave in the Pacific Northwest, which killed hundreds of people in the U.S. and Canada, was a harbinger of a new generation of climate disasters to come, a new study finds.\n",
      "\n",
      " In the most comprehensive analysis to date of what made the heat wave so extreme scientists ruled out the possibility this was a \"black swan\" event, which is unpredictable and unlikely to recur.\n",
      "\n",
      " Instead, the new study in Nature Climate Change shows that amplifying feedbacks between factors such as unusually dry soils and a highly contorted jet stream added to the effects of long-term climate change.This dialed up the heat to unprecedented levels for the region. The wavy jet stream pattern, itself tied to climate change, helped give rise to a record-strong heat dome that parked itself over British Columbia and the Northwest U.S. in early summer. The study finds that in the Northwest but likely other areas as well, multiple trends are pushing the climate into a zone where such extremes are far more likely. “The background warming, the atmospheric dynamics, and the soil moisture deficiency interacted in a way that amplified this event beyond a normal extreme,” study coauthor Kai Kornhuber, a senior fellow at the German Council on Foreign Relations, tells Axios in an interview.\n",
      "\n",
      " In the 1950s, the study states, the prospect of such a heat wave occurring in the Pacific Northwest was virtually impossible, but climate change had transformed that into a 1-in-200-year event by 2021.Part of the reason for this is the gradual drying seen across the region. \"Our study is the first to pinpoint how warming-induced land drying has transitioned the Pacific Northwest from a wet region without effective soil moisture-temperature feedbacks to a transitional climate between wet and dry,\" said study coauthor Mingfang Ting of Columbia University. \"That can strengthen land-atmosphere feedbacks and thus large temperature swings.\"Kornhuber says that while it is \"encouraging\" that models used for weather forecasting captured the heat wave's likely development and severity, climate models used to conduct risk assessments for heat hazards in coming decades may be flawed. If they are missing some of the feedbacks the study identifies, climate models could underplay the risk of a repeat or even worse event. Looking ahead, if climate change is held to 2°C above the pre-industrial average, 2021-type Pacific Northwest heat events are likely to take place at a frequency of about once every 10 years.\n",
      "\n",
      " Even if all existing emissions pledges are met, the world is currently headed for greater than 2°C of warming .\n",
      "\n",
      " \"Our study supports a very direct conclusion that extreme heat like this will only become more and more likely — both in this region and across the globe, especially where heat stress is already extremely high — as more fossil fuels are burned,\" lead author Samuel Bartusek of Columbia University told Axios via email.\n",

A candlelight vigil on Friday night in Shanghai turned into a demonstration against COVID restrictions. On Saturday and late into the night on Sunday, protests spread across at least eight cities, including Beijing and Wuhan.

      "\n",
      " What might sound like a joke is actually a project that could have health benefits for dogs’ brains.\n",
      "\n",
      " Joipaw’s games, which are still being prototyped, run on a custom saliva-resistant touch-screen console that the canine competitors play with their snouts.Games include a whack-a-mole challenge and a test to see if the doggie gamer can pick which side of an image contains more bubbles. When the dogs succeed, the console dispenses treats. A motion-sensitive tracker on the dog’s collar may also allow for additional control of some games.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Joipaw co-founder Dersim Avdar is a lifelong gamer and initially pondered the dog game concept as a way to keep his and his wife’s mixed-breed dog Kawet occupied when their particularly active pet wanted more attention than they could give.Avdar soon realized the idea might have deeper potential to aid dogs’ health. He read a 2017 study from several European researchers that tested simple touch-screen games on nearly 300 dogs (and 20 wolves) and found potential cognitive benefits for dogs with aging brains. “I'm taking the torch that these researchers lit and bringing it further,” Avdar tells Axios. He notes that Joipaw’s games are not meant to be a replacement for spending time with your dog.\n",
      "\n",
      " Avdar’s dog games start off more simply than human games do, and it takes more coaxing to get dogs to start playing.While the earliest stages of the whack-a-mole game display a single critter, getting the dog’s attention takes putting peanut butter on the screen. In tests with nearly two dozen dogs, “the most difficult step” has been getting dogs to start playing without peanut butter on the screen, Avdar says, but, when they do, it’s “the magic moment where you see the light in their eyes.” After that, the idea is a mental workout for the dog, a potential half-hour challenge that can also tire a hard-thinking dog.\n",
      "\n",
      " Research into touch-screen brain games for dogs is young but “very promising,” says Clara Mancini, a professor of animal-computer interaction at The Open University in the U.K. and science adviser to Joipaw.She believes video games can offer benefits that other puzzle dog toys can’t, because they can be designed to become progressively more difficult.There is hope the tech can help dogs suffering from dementia or enrich those who are less active because they are in shelters, but she says more study is needed.\n",
      "\n",
      " Joipaw fits within the larger field of animal-computer interaction and the creation of tech that can benefit animals and help people understand them.In this framework, Mancini says, most existing technology is understood as things that humans made to out-compete other species. “The idea is to try and develop technology that starts to reduce the gap between humans and animals rather than increase it,” Mancini says.\n",
      "\n",
      " Avdar doesn’t have a timeframe for Joipaw’s release and is working out a pricing model for both the device and a subscription that’ll dole out games.He hopes to offer a wide range of games, including one about avoiding a hedgehog’s spikes that is designed for a dog to play against a human. He also plans to offer Joipaw owners a leaderboard (owners of dogs who tested the project kept asking him how their pups stacked up to other canines). A global scoreboard could stoke more competition, he realizes: “I can totally imagine dog esports.”\n",

At the same time, a wave of layoffs and resignations of Twitter staff and contractors have decimated the teams responsible for monitoring and taking action against rule-breaking accounts.\n",

      "\n",
      " In results of the poll, conducted on behalf of Ultraviolet, GLAAD, Kairos, and the Women's March, 57 percent of respondents said they have seen a post that calls for actual violence against someone based on their race, gender, sexuality, or another personal characteristic.Women and people who identify as LGBTQ+ reported higher rates of harassment than the average respondent. Respondents described false information as an issue across multiple platforms, with Facebook and Twitter being seen as the most problematic, and a large majority said the platforms should be held accountable.\n",

      " Civil rights groups have already pointed to a rise in racist and antisemitic tweets under Elon Musk even ahead of moves to reinstate previously banned accounts.Advocates have been sounding alarms about growing risks of online hate speech translating into real-world violence, with renewed warnings after this month's shooting in Colorado Springs.\n",
      "\n",
      " Musk's amnesty declaration suggests that Twitter's old speech rules no longer apply, and henceforth only law-breaking, \"egregious spam\" and calls to violence will cause Twitter to take action.That appears to leave the door wide open for hate speech, abuse, bullying and targeted harassment.Musk followed up his pledge to reinstate previously banned accounts with a call for civil debate on the site, but offered no plan for how to encourage it. Musk said in a Twitter conversation with author Stephen King on Saturday that his goal is \"a trusted digital town square, where a wide range of views are tolerated, provided people don’t break the law or spam.\" He also promised that \"any incitement to violence will result in account suspension.\"\n",
      "\n",
      " Critics of Musk’s approach say that he is asking for civil debates where the starting point is inherently un-civil, as when people express white supremacy or equate LGBTQ identity with child abuse.\"I cannot 'engage in civil debate' about whether or not I am who I say I am or whether I should exist, but ok, dude,\" transgender writer Parker Molloy said in response to Musk.\n",
      "\n",
      " Musk's toleration of a broader range of hateful speech might pass legal muster in the U.S. but is likely to run afoul of laws in many nations around the world.\n",

      "\n",
      " Existing home sales have fallen for nine straight months . The supply of single-family homes is growing. And with mortgage rates near 7%, experts say a large-scale housing slowdown is becoming increasingly likely.\n",
      "\n",
      " \"In one line: Collapse in prices is coming,\" wrote Kieran Clancy, senior U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.Pantheon estimates that existing home prices will keep falling, ultimately dropping by about 20% from their June peak of around $414,000. Goldman Sachs analysts also recently cut their outlook for home prices, from roughly flat next year to down 4%, noting that \"unsustainable levels of housing affordability to continue weighing on housing demand.\"\n",
      "\n",
      " Until recently, economists had pooh-poohed the prospect of a nationwide price slump, suggesting that persistently low inventories of houses to buy would put something of a floor under the market.Even if demand fell because of surging mortgage rates, they reasoned, there would still be enough buyers for the relatively small number of houses for sale, meaning prices likely wouldn't drop much.\n",
      "\n",
      " While analysts are coming around to the idea that house prices could see a correction, they still don't expect an outright bust.Unemployment remains low. And most homeowners who bought in recent years have locked in rock-bottom rates, making their payments affordable. That means a surge in defaults — like the one that crashed the U.S. housing market in 2008 and 2009 — is unlikely, economists say.\n",
      "\n",
      " Some decline in home prices is likely in the offing. It won't be a disaster. And lower prices will be welcomed by frustrated, would-be buyers.\n",

      " The world's most populous nation has massive vulnerabilities heading into this winter, starting with the fact the vast majority of its population has yet to be exposed to the virus and has little 'natural immunity.'China's vaccines didn't work well compared to those distributed in the West, and the government refused to approve foreign vaccines and doesn’t have a version to combat Omicron. Vaccine uptake was particularly low among the elderly. And now, public outrage over new COVID lockdown restrictions has fueled rare protests, Axios' Herb Scribner writes, with residents demanding the government to lift restrictions quickly and some calling for President Xi Jinping's resignation.\n",
      "\n",
      " Overall, China's number of reported COVID cases and COVID deaths are far lower than other nations, but there have been recent reported spikes in overall numbers of cases and some new deaths .It came after the Chinese government announced some easing of its zero-COVID policy, such as reducing mass testing and quarantine requirements, earlier this month.\n",

Experts have said the vaccine, which was found to stimulate a mucosal response, may create more durable protection against the virus, although more data is needed.

      "\n",
      " Consumers want their stuff fast, and under Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' vision, they could get it delivered in as little as 30 minutes while helping the environment by taking CO2-emitting trucks off the street.But a host of technical and regulatory hurdles stand in the way, which is why drone deliveries in the U.S. are progressing slowly.\n",

      " Amazon showed off its next-generation drone at a recent event near Boston to highlight the future of delivery.The 80-pound hexagon-shaped aircraft, about 5½ feet in diameter, is nimble enough to make deliveries in highly populated areas such as Boston, Atlanta and Seattle. It'll be more capable and less intrusive than the model Amazon is using in its Prime Air service, which will begin in two markets — Lockeford, California, and College Station, Texas — in the coming weeks. By the end of the decade, the company's goal is to deliver 500 million packages a year by drone in cities, Amazon Prime Air vice president David Carbon told reporters.\n",
      "\n",
      " The new aircraft, dubbed MK30, has a longer range and can fly in more types of weather — including light rain — than the drone it'll use in the near term.It also has new \"sense-and-avoid\" safety features that allow it to operate at greater distances while skirting other aircraft, people, pets and obstacles. Custom-designed propellers reduce the perceived noise by 25%, Amazon said. Thousands of items could be eligible for drone delivery as long as they fit in one box and weigh less than 5 pounds total.\n",

      " Amazon has been pursuing drone delivery for nearly a decade, but the program has been beset by delays and internal strife, as Bloomberg reported earlier this year.It's lagging behind Walmart, which says it's expanding its DroneUp delivery network to 34 sites in six states.Other players, including Zipline and Google-owned Wing, have also begun drone deliveries for hospitals and retail partners such as Walgreens.\n",

Upon arrival, the drone descends, scans the area to make sure it's clear, then drops the box from a height of about 12 feet.\n",
